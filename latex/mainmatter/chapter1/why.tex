\section{Why another TCG Program for Magic?} 

It's simple, because the programs which are there dont satisfy me. Some are good because they have many functions like drafting, but only very few people use it. Some are good with automatic rule handling, but the cost as much as cards in real life. I dont like to pay for virtuell stuff which are also avaible in real life. Futhermore i like Open Source stuff. sure there is one Open Source tool around which is ok for testing, but it lags in the functionality and the look. It's just feel crappy, sure it does it's job but it can't handle rule interaction and it also lags in the kinds of gaming. 
So I started this project so everybody who wants to change something or to add soemthing just can do it, by joining this project.
In this Project i don't jsut want to make a better tool for testing you new deck, I also wanted to make it for all plattforms avaible which are out there. I don't want a tool just for Windows or Linux it should also connect via your android so that you can check you trader bin and you deck ideas on the fly. Futhermore I want that people can play with their tablets with people on a normal computer. Wouldn't it be nice to play against a friend with your tablets? That's the only reason i would buy one beside it's a mediocre ebook reader.
